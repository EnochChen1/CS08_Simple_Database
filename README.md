I made this in Fall of 2021. This was made with C++, and was a simple database made from scratch. I created tokenizers, bplustrees, state machines, and etc. for this.


To run this, first you must have your terminal go to ..\99_final\build. Then you must run ..\99_final\build\build.bat. This will build the program. Then you can use the terminal to run .\main to start creating a table, inserting values into the table, get a table of selected fields and conditions, and other functions for your database.
